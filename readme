To Do List
========================================================

Top Priority
  - side bar checkbox to switch major / minor curve
  - handle point merging for coradial constraints

Everything Else
  - shapes->cancel. cancels interactive create? deletes the shape unless its created?
  - show guides on select. hide guides on deselect (unless it's being created)
  - file menu (orb or whatever they call it) or maybe just a save button?
  - guide points? (for ovals extra drag points?)
    - excluded from the points and shapes arrays
  - oval drag and drop math so that drag is on the ellipse, not rx/ry
  - oval drag points on each axis (including rotation) (guides)
  - refactor shape drag and drop and sketch dragging to share code
  - save to svg
  - export cnc-ready dwg
  - export cnc-ready svg
  - add a list of shapes constrained to each point (merging in coincident code?)
  - 2 point tangental arcs
  - 3 point circles

Very Low (probably bs) Priority box o' shit
  - constraints -> sketch extension
  - merging coradial constraints

Done
  - refactor lines to use shape.coffee
  - refactor arcs to use shape.coffee
  - basic ovals implementation
  - wrap all shape functions with the expected "this" context.
  - merge coincident points.
  - points merge properly on initial drag
  - refactor drag and drop to share code between arc dragging, circle dragging, and point dragging
  - delete shape
  - make points into proper objects like shapes
