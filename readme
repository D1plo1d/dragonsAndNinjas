To Do List
========================================================

Top Priority
  - oval drag and drop math so that drag is on the ellipse, not rx/ry
  - oval drag points on each axis (including rotation) (guides)

Everything Else
  - merge coincident points. add a list of shapes constrained to each point (merging in coincident code?)
  - points merge properly on initial drag
  - refactor drag and drop to share code between arc dragging, circle dragging, point dragging and screen dragging
  - save to svg
  - export cnc-ready dwg
  - export cnc-ready svg
  - delete shape
  - unselect event in shapes. kills interactive create.
  - make points into proper objects like shapes
  - 2 point tangental arcs
  - 3 point circles

Done
  - refactor lines to use shape.coffee
  - refactor arcs to use shape.coffee
  - basic ovals implementation
  - wrap all shape functions with the expected "this" context.
