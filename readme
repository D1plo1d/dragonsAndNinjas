To Do List
========================================================

Top Priority
 - refactor lines to use shape.coffee
 - refactor drag and drop to share code between arc dragging, circle dragging, point dragging and screen dragging

Everything Else
  - save to svg
  - export cnc-ready dwg
  - export cnc-ready svg
  - delete shape
  - unselect event in shapes. kills interactive create.
  - merge coincident points. add a list of shapes constrained to each point (merging in coincident code?)
  - make points into proper objects like shapes
  - wrap all shape functions with the expected "this" context.
  - 2 point tangental arcs
  - points merge properly on initial drag

Done
 - refactor arcs to use shape.coffee
