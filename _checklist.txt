DONE (previous major features)

- Dimension tool UI and programatic interfaces ++5%
  - drag the element to change it's line offset
    - dragging text (make it a full fledged shape??) [DONE]
    - dragging line element [DONE]
  - edit the dimension size
    - clicking the text opens a field overlaying the text [DONE]
    - the field is saved by pressing enter or deselecting. [DONE]
    - the field is regex'd as a measurement [DONE]
    - whenever a valid measurement is entered the dimension size updates. [DONE]
  - text sizing
    - blank area should match number of digits (text method: getSize() -> $v) [DONE]
    - vertical dimensions should have less room for the measurement numbers then horizontal dimensions. [DONE]
  - dimension lines should select when a dimension text is selected. [DONE]
  - small dimensions should offset their text so the dimension's text doesn't overlap the dimension's line. [DONE]

- Zoom ++4%
  - keyboard shortcuts (- and + because ctrl+ and ctrl- are firmly bound to the browser atm) [DONE]
  - scroll wheel [DONE]
  - resizing
    - text resizing (for consistant screen text size) [DONE]
    - dimension spacing re-rendering (based on text size changes) [DONE]
    - line thickness rescaling (line thickness should be consistent regardless of zoom) [DONE]
  - standardized mousemove, mouseup and mousedown events with $vMouse [DONE]
  - points snapping should still work when zoomed to non-default levels [DONE]
  - moving dimension text should scale to zoom-relative movements [DONE]
  - ui created points should be created at the current mouse position regardless of zoom [DONE]
  - dimension text editing box should appear correctly positioned regardless of zoom [DONE]

- SVG + HTML improvements ++1%
  - SVG should automatically scale and resize to take up the full screen [DONE]
  - The page should never scroll (even if a dimension's text field is way out in the middle of nowhere). [DONE]



DONE (previous Top Priority ++7% items)

  - minified alt horizontal dimension texts are offsetting in the wrong direction and not far enough

  - Shape deletion [0 hr 30 min]
    - prevent wild fire deletion of all connected shapes. Only delete the currently selected shape. If a point's deletion is prevented by other shapes not currently being deleted hold off on deleting that point.

  - Shape + subserviant point Selection [1 hr 15 min]
    - select element and its points when creating or selecting an element.
    - When selecting a point if it is part of the currently selected element do not unselect the element
    - prevent selecting an element until the current element has _created = true

  - actually hide the context menu (isn't working atm) [freebee, included in shape and subserviant point selection]

  - delete is once again broken due to the new selection system [ 0 hr 45 min ]

  - Cancel
    - shapes->cancel. cancels interactive create? deletes the shape unless its created?
    - cancel the current shape when creating a new shape via interactive create
    - esc keyboard shortcut for cancel




Yet to be done
==============


Top Priority Bugs ++7%
--------------------------------------------------------

  - vertical dimensions still overlap text and lines even when in the alt-minimized state (needs more offset!)

  - point merge should prefer explicit to implicit (ie merging a explicit point with a implicit should result in a explicit point)

  - the mouse sometimes gets offset to the right of where the elements are being positioned.. wtf?

  - arc non-dragged points should not snap to other points when moving (breaks the coradial illusion)
  - deleting an arc does not delete it's coradial constraint
  - deleting an arc does not delete it's guides

  - create arc - click to create center point, click and drag to create 2nd point and bug.
  - create line - click to create first point, click to create second point and bug.
    - bug: shape's points get deleted somehow and element is either non-visible or deleted

  - artifacting of points in svg. Happens on Geordie's box as well. WTF?

  - Arc + clockwise + angle < 180 degrees results in the wrong arc (about a incorrect center point). Why? How do we fix this?
  - Click arc, place a first point, move the mouse quickly and place a second point but without clicking on the point itself when you place the point. Now you can't create the 3rd point and when you click it cancels the creation and kills the arc (not killing the guides)
  - deleting an arc durring it's creation does not delete it's guides

  - sometimes in arc creation you need to click twice before you place the 3rd point

  - when you click and drag an element and then move the mouse off screen and release the element continues to be dragged. In these lost focus situations it would be better to stop dragging the element and treat it as a mouse up event.

  - when you make a dimension's text box further right then the edge of the screen and type in a new value it trys to scroll the screen over to that text box in the middle of nowhere and screws with the illusion that this CAD program doesn't suck.
    - prevent text boxes from displaying if they are further left then the document width
    - auto zoom to fit when a dimension is larger then the screen can display.


Missing Features
--------------------------------------------------------

- File Tab ++10%
  - redo + undo
    - point.split(options, lines, constraints) -> splits the given lines (and eventually constraints) off into a new point which by default is is in ui create (dragged by the user). Required for undoing point merges.
  - save + load
    - sketch needs to be reset on load. [DONE]
    - points in the same position should be merged when their created (or simply not created) so that
      deserializing automatically faithfully recreates the points of the sketch [DONE]
    - resaving does not include the loaded shapes [DONE]
    - File list functionality should be shared between Open and Save modals. A jQuery UI plugin can be used here.
    - File lists should be able to select multiple files via shift and ctrl.
    - The delete key should be able to delete them.
    - A delete button should be at the bottom left of each file modal to delete selected files.
    - Deleting a file should launch a small modal confirmation dialog

- Constraint Solver
  - initial implementation of constraints ++30%
  - resulting bugs and feature improvements ++40%

- QTip2 Tutorial ++3%
  - choose a shape you wish to create.
  - draw you shape on the screen by clicking to place each of it's points.
  - you can now create more shapes or click on an existing shape or point to move it.
